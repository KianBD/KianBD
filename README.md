- 👋 Hi, I’m @KianBD
- 👀 I am a full stack developer that is self-taught and proficient in 6 different programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my skills in C++, Back-End development and machine learning.
- 💞️ My plans for the future are to study CS at MIT after HS and get employed as a full stack software engineer. After I have developed my hands-on skills and saved up enough money I will be building my own company.
